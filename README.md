# stopMovingBallter
its Ballter and his neighbor the moving wall - he was far to scared to hit him, but would hit him in a heartbeat now

## Backstory
In a small town called Mall York there lived a little man called Ballter. 
Ballter was a friendly guy over and over.
UNTIL Wallter moved next to Ballter and disturbed his peace. 
His meaning of life is now to hit Wallter as hard as he can - till nothing of Wallter is left to hit.
